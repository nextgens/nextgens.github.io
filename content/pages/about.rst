Florent is the Technical Director of `Matta Consulting`_, a boutique security consultancy firm with headquaters in London, UK. He has a MS in Real Time and Embedded programming from `Université de Technologie Belfort-Montbéliard`_.

By day, he is raising security awareness; training people and breaking things on request for a select few clients, and annoying vendors exposing obvious bugs in popular security products. In 2012, he was awarded a Pwnie Award at Black Hat for exposing `the Most Epic Fail of the year`_.

By night, and for over a decade now, he is secretly working on Freenet_, a decentralized, peer-to-peer censorship resistant tool allowing to publish and retrieve content anonymously.

Florent can be found in various corners of the web, but should you intend on having a private conversation with him, you should use his `GPG key`_.
